# Pandoc Blog

This my attempt to make a static site generator using primarily Pandoc.

## Goals

* Site will generate linked HTML files, similar to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)
* Individual posts can be rendered as PDFs
* All posts can be compiled to either PDF or EPub formats
* Site will be compatible with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/)
* Generated with a simple makefile
